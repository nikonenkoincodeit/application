# Suadeo

Suadeo Quasar Application

## Install the dependencies
```bash
yarn
```

### Start the app in development mode (hot-code reloading, error reporting, etc.)
```bash
quasar dev
```

### Lint the files
```bash
yarn run lint
```

### Build the app for production
```bash
quasar build
```

### Having trouble with the linter?
try `yarn run lint --fix` first.  If that doesnt then try in-line ignores.  There is no reason for blanket function (or above) ignores.
